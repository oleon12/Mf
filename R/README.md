# R-scripts

***

1. **MCP.R:** Create a Minimum Convex Polygon using the initial occurrences
2. **Model.R:** Build and evaluate the MaxEnt model for the 'present-day' variables 
3. **Model_Fut.R:** Project the MaxEnt model into future climate conditions
4. **Areas_Fut.R:** Calculate the loss, gain and stable areas of the projected future climate conditions
5. **Areas_PA.R:** Calculate the area of the potential distribution that are within the protected areas

Many scripts use the  WorldClim v2 (2.5') bioclimate variables, so, if you want to use these scripts, you must go to the website of [WorldClime](https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) and download it.
